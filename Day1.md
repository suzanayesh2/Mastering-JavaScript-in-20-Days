# Day1 : introduction :
## 1-Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication :
In first challenge I should convert the multiplication that wrote normal way to profosinal way.
### Code:
let a =5;
a = a * 5;
___________
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *=  5;
b *= 3 ;
c *=  10;
## 2-Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication :
In first challenge I should convert the multiple operation that wrote normal way to profosinal way.
### Code :
let a = 48;
a = a / 12;
___________
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /=  11;
