## Data Fetching & Promises

- Using the fetch function to load data from an API endpoint on the internet. If the request is successful, the API will respond with data contained in a JSON object.
- Using the await operator to wait for a Promise and obtain its resulting value. If the await operator is not used, JavaScript will return the promise object without the value of the promise.
- The Promise we get it from fetch that resolve to a Response object or Rejected or fulfilled.
